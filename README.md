# Data-Encryption-with-AES-and-RSA
Here I have combined both the AES and the RSA algorithms on Python to provide a more strong data security and increasing the efficiency of the encryption.

# Technology Used:
-Google Colab

-PyCrypto

-PyCryptodomex

-Python 3

-Random

-Itertools

-Functools

# Features:
-This program at first will take a plain text and AES key as input.

-Then it will encrypt the plain text with the AES key.

-Next It will take input the RSA key size.

-After that it will print the RSA public and private keys.

-And will encrypt the AES key by the generated RSA public key.

-Later it will decrypt the AES key by using the RSA private key.

-Finally this AES key is used to decrypt the encrypted plain text.

# Guidelines to Run this Project
-Go to colab.research.google.com

-Create a new notebook.

-Copy everything from my source file and paste in Google colab and run


-Or you can just open my souce file and click "Open in colab" and you can run it from there directly!
